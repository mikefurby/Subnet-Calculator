# Subnet-Calculator
Input an IP address with a mask and it will return the Network address and Broadcast address of the subnet

I am learning Python to help with my presales activities. So, anyone looking at this should probably use a different 
subnet calc because this one is very limited in it's capability as I only needed it for v4. When it comes to serious 
programming, I have colleagues who do this for a living so I would sell their services as part of a deal.
